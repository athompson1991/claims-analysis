The main presentation is in the aptly titled file `presentation.ipynb`. However, to run the code itself you first clone this repo, create two directories named "plots" and "data", then save the data file into the data repository, renaming it to "full.csv". After installing all the required libraries into your python environment, you can easily run the script with `python script.py`
